## Overview

### The challenge üéØ 
The challenge was to build a responsive e-commerce product web page for mobile and desktop devices, following the design files and trying to keep as close as possible to them.

The users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size ‚úîÔ∏è
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page ‚úîÔ∏è
- Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image ‚úîÔ∏è
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images ‚úîÔ∏è
- Add items to the cart ‚úîÔ∏è
- View the cart and remove items from it ‚úîÔ∏è

### About the app built 
It's an e-commerce product web page, you can add the item (autumn sneakers) to the cart how many times you want, see all the images about the product by clicking on the arrow buttons (mobile & lightbox opened) or by the thumb images below the main image (only screens with >= 992px).

## üõ†Ô∏è How to run the project
- You can download or clone the project, once you have the files you'll need a server to run the application. You can use the *live server* from visual studio code, for example. The main file is the ```index.html```
- You can access the [live site](https://Vyktuur.github.io/e-commerce-product-page/)
